# NetworkSimulation
This application simulates the forwarding operation of a router and the distribution function of an ISP. Router 1 is generating packets at different rates. Router 2 is listening for the packets. When it recieves them, it then uses it's forwarding table (which is in dot notation) to determine which ISP to send them to. ISP A and ISP B listens for the packets and then use their forwarding tables (which are in slash notation) to determine which subnets to send them to. The number of packets sent to each subnet will be listed. Open four different command lines. Start by running R1, then R2, after ISPA, and finish with ISPB.
